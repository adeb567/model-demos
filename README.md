# model-demos

Steps for Individual Apps:

- Setup the Flask environment using: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-flask

- Set the model path in app.py (For SVAM - download the pretrained model weights from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19OyCuvZ0sLlHdmF1TrDRa4QrFLwhCWRk)

- Run the app using 'python3 app.py'

Steps for Integrated App:

- Setup the Flask environment using: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-flask

- Set the model paths in app.py in Intregated/demo*

  (For SVAM - download the pretrained model weights from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19OyCuvZ0sLlHdmF1TrDRa4QrFLwhCWRk and place it in Intregated/demo3/models)

  Intregated/demo1 - FUnIE
  Intregated/demo2 - Deep_SESR
  Intregated/demo3 - SVAM

- Run the app using 'python3 app.py' in /Integrated
